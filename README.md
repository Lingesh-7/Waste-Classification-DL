# ðŸ—‘ Waste Classification

## Overview  
This project focuses on **automated waste classification** using the **YOLOv5s** object detection model and also by uploadi. By leveraging deep learning, the system efficiently identifies and categorizes waste items, contributing to **smart waste management and environmental sustainability**.  

## Features  
- **Real-time object detection** for various waste categories.  
- **Pretrained YOLOv5s model** for optimized accuracy.  
- **Dataset processing and augmentation** for improved classification.  
- **Deployment-ready API for integration** into waste management systems.  

## Technologies Used  
- **YOLOv5s** â€“ Object detection.  
- **Python & OpenCV** â€“ Image processing.  
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data handling.  
- **FastAPI or Flask** â€“ API integration (optional).  

## Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lingesh-7/Waste-Classification-YOLOv5
cd Waste-Classification-YOLOv5
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results  
The model identifies waste items with bounding boxes and class labels, making it useful for **smart sorting and automated disposal systems**.  

## Future Improvements  
- Enhance the dataset for **better classification accuracy**.  
- Integrate with **IoT waste management systems**.  
- Implement **cloud-based inference** for scalability.
